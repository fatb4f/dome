# Agent instructions (project-level)

Read and follow:
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (SSOT)

Operate strictly as: **PLAN → EXECUTE → GATE**

- PLAN: Create/modify `.specify/specs/<feature>/spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md` only.
- EXECUTE: Use tools, flags, env vars, logs, redirection to capture maximal signals.
- GATE: Update checklists, tasks completion, and durable memory/preferences **only when** evidence is present.

Never mark work as DONE without evidence (tests/logs/artifacts) and a recorded provenance pointer.
